Stopping the radar
==================

On 'drx', run:

  start_xpol_control

This will bring up the control GUI.

Go through the following steps:

(a) Connect to the xpold server
-------------------------------

Click 'Connect' - this connects xpol_control to xpold.

(b) Make sure the server is in run mode.
----------------------------------------

Set 'Server state' to 'Run'
Click 'Apply'

After hitting Apply, you will see a message saying that the
server configuration is updating. You need to wait until
this message goes away.

(c) Point the antenna vertically
--------------------------------

Make sure the antenna is pointed vertically up, so there is
no radiation hazard. This is done in the 'Pedestal' section.

Set:

  Action: Point
  Az position: 0
  El position: 90
  Az velocity: 10
  El velocity: 10

  Click 'Apply' in the upper-right hand window.

Make sure the elevation is close to 90 degrees - i.e. the 
antenna is pointing vertically.

  Click 'Stop' to set the brakes.

(d) Turn off the transmitter
----------------------------

  Set 'Frequency tracking' to 'Manual'.
  Click on 'RF power' to remove the check mark.
  Click 'Apply'

  Monitor the 'Power:' value. This starts around -12 dBm.
  The power should decrease to around -85 dBm or nan.

(d) Turn off dry air power
--------------------------

  Click on 'Dry air power' to remove the check mark.
  Click 'Apply'.

(e) Stop processes on xpol

--------------------------

On xpol, do 'stop_all'.
