Stopping processes on xpol server
=================================

Before starting DRX, make sure the processes on xpol are stopped.

  Log in to xpol as 'radarop' using the -X option
  Run 'stop_all'

Starting up DRX server
======================

Log in to drx server as user 'radarop'.  You can just type 'drx'.

Run:

  start_all

to start up the basic system.

The main app running on 'drx' is:

  xpold

This is the server that controls the radar, and acquires the data.

We run apps on 'xpol' that contact this server.

Starting the radar
==================

On 'drx', run:

  start_xpol_control

This will bring up the control GUI.  You may want to resize the window to
get rid of any scrollbars.

Go through the following steps:

(a) Connect to the xpold server
-------------------------------

Click 'Connect' - this connects xpol_control to xpold.

(b) Make sure the server is in run mode.
----------------------------------------

Set 'Server state' to 'Run'
Click 'Apply' in the lower center of the GUI.  (This will be the apply
that you click unless otherwise specified below.)

After hitting Apply, you will see a message saying that the
server configuration is updating. You need to wait until
this message goes away.

(c) Point the antenna vertically
--------------------------------

Make sure the antenna is pointed vertically up, so there is
no radiation hazard. This is done in the 'Pedestal' section.

Set:

  Action: Point
  Az position: 0
  El position: 90
  Az velocity: 10
  El velocity: 10

  Click 'Apply' in the top right-hand window.

Make sure the elevation is close to 90 degrees - i.e. the 
antenna is pointing vertically.

  Click 'Stop' to set the brakes.

(d) Turn on dry air power, to keep the antenna ventilated.
---------------------------------------------------------

  Click on 'Dry air power' to get a check mark.
  Click 'Apply'.

(e) Turn on the transmitter
---------------------------

  Click on 'RF power' to get a check mark.
  Set 'Frequency tracking' to 'Manual'.
  Click 'Apply'

  Set 'LO Frequency' to 17.0
  Click 'Apply'.

  Monitor the 'Power:' value. This starts around -85 dBm.
  The power should increase to around -12 dBm.
  This can take a few minutes as the transmitter warms up.

  Once the Power is around -12:

    Set 'Frequency tracking' to 'Auto'.

  This will set on the automatic frequency control on to track the
  magnetron frequency and keep the power at an optimum value.

  Also set the following values:
       Range resolution:   75m
       Filter bandwidth:    2MHz
       Range gate spacing: 75m
  Then click 'Apply'

Ensure safety radius
====================

The radar has a 30 meter safety radius. This applies when the antenna
is pointing below 10 degrees or so.

Make sure no one is close to the radar before turning it on.

Start processes on xpol server
==============================

  Log in to xpol
  Run 'start_all'

This will start up the data acquisition and xpol control.

Run:

  start_RadMon.xpol
  start_RadMon.xpol_raw

to monitor the FMQ data streams..  It can take a little while before you
see data in the RadMon windows.  You will first see data in the xpol_raw
window as the raw data starts to flow.  The xpol window will only show data
that is actually within our scan strategy.

Run:

  start_HawkEye.xpol

to see the beam-by-beam data.

Run CIDD on vapor to check volume data
======================================

Log into vapor as ice.

Run:

  start_CIDD.xpol_vapor

to see the CIDD display.


When everything is up and running, kill the xpol_control GUI.
Note that mulitple versions of the GUI can run at the same time
so killing the GUI should save some confusion.
